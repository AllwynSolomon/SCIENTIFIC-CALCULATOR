# SCIENTIFIC-CALCULATOR

The main aim of the project is a GUI Design for Scientific Calculator.

The project was developed in Eclipse using the Java Swing package.

Using Java Swing over AWT for the GUI development was beneficial since:
  1. It is Lightweight.
  2. Offers more Powerful components compared to AWT.
  3. Swing components are not platform-independent and can be run anywhere.

REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
  1. External Interfaces:
      The Scientific Calculator will use all essential input and output devices such as Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor.
  2. Hardware Interfaces:
      The system can run on Windows 8 or Later, Mac OS or Linux.
  3. Software Used and Functional Methods:
     > 1. Eclipse IDE 2021-12 for Java Development
     > 2. WindowBuilder 1.9.8
     > 3. Xampp v3.3.0
     > 4. MySQL 8.0.28
